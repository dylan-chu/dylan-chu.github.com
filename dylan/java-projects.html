	<br>
	<p>This Android app helps Chinese learners build up their English vocabulary in a methodical way.  I developed this app using Android Studio 1.5 and it was recently published to the Amazon app store and to one of the largest app stores in China.</p>

        <h2>Let's Talk Chinese</h2>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="bamboo.png">
	<br>
	<p>Leveraging my experience of living in Beijing for almost 10 years, I am developing an app to help people who visit or move to China.  This Android app will aid English speakers to master some useful phrases in Mandarin.  It is being developed with Android Studio 2.0 and should be published to an app store in about a month.</p>

	<br>
	<p>I built this website to help me get rid of the stuff that was crowding my small apartment in Beijing.  It allows people to share information with the friends of their friends.  The front end was built using HTML and CSS with layout management provided by Bootstrap and AJAX functionality provided by JQuery.  The back end consists of servlets running on Tomcat with caching provided by memcached.  Data is stored in MySQL and Neo4J.</p>

	<br>
	<p>This website was used to manage the developers that I hired to take part in the experiments that I conducted for the thesis for my master's degree.  It allows developers to reserve a coding task and submit their completed work to the website.  The system  automatically verifies that the submitted code passes all the tests specified for the task.  It was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, Tomcat, memcached, MySQL and shell scripts.</p>

        <h2>Multiplayer Sudoku</h2>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="sudoku-host.png">
	<br>
	<p>This game, built using Swing, allows multiple players to work on a Sudoku puzzle together.  The creation of a puzzle was done using the backtracking algorithm.  In the future, I will implement the more efficient dancing links algorithm to achieve the same goal.</p>

	<br>
	<p>This desktop application uses the graphics capabilities in Swing to draw a graph indicating the popularity of male and female names for the past 110 years.  It was built with the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and the data for the application came from a CSV file.</p>
